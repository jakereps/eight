# eight

This is a [chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) implementation, in Go.
The thought was to gain a bit of experience working with emulators before diving
back into the Gameboy emulator I started a while back. This may be a bit _too_
easy, though, looking into it. The number of instructions is essentially nothing
compared to a Gameboy, and it doesn't seem to have near the amount of
capabilities. Either way it seems like a fun toy project to tinker on. Oh well.
